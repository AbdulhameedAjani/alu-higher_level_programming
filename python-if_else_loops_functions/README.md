#  Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I was able to learn about various concepts such as: 
* The importance of indentation in Python
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
* How to use comments
* How to add values to variables
* How to use the `while` and `for` loops
* How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
* How to use `range` etc.

The project presented a challenge due to the numerous concepts that needed to be covered. However, the experience was also intriguing as I discovered several fascinating concepts in Python.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**Task-0**: The [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py) file contains an update to the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py target="_blank") that prints whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

**Task-1**: The [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py) file contains an update to the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) that prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`

**Task-2**: The [2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py) file contains a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

**Task-3**: The [3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py) contains a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line with the exception of `q` and `e`

**Task-4**: The [4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py) contain a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
```sh
	guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./4-print_hexa.py
	0 = 0x0
	1 = 0x1
	2 = 0x2
	3 = 0x3
	4 = 0x4
	5 = 0x5
	6 = 0x6
	7 = 0x7
	8 = 0x8
	9 = 0x9
	10 = 0xa
	11 = 0xb
	12 = 0xc
	13 = 0xd
	14 = 0xe
	15 = 0xf
	16 = 0x10
	17 = 0x11
	18 = 0x12
	...
	96 = 0x60
	97 = 0x61
	98 = 0x62

```

**Task-5**: The [5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py) file contains a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.

**Task-6**: The [6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py) file contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits with `01` and `10` being considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`. The output should be:
```sh
	guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./6-print_comb3.py
	01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 56, 57, 58, 59, 67, 	68, 69, 78, 79, 89
